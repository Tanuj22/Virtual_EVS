# Virtual Electroic Voting Service
Election is backbone of Democracy therefore it should be secure and hassle free process.</br>
To make it hassle free and easily accessible we proposed to make it a online process using Blockchain Technology. Blockchain can provide the solutions for the problems we might face if we start using online voting system</br>

## Our proposed Solution


We will issue Blockchain based e-voter Id which contains all neccessary informations like biometric, Aadhar details after registration only to the person who is eligible for voting. We will also provide a platform where candidates can register for the election which will be verified by a third party like National Election Commission of India.</br>
It is completely Blockchain based online voting system so that a person can cast vote from anywhwere securely.</br>
On day of Election a person can login to the page using issued e voter Id and user will be  verified using fingerprint and clicked photo. After verification user will be redirected to vote casting page where a list of candidates in his constituency will appear and he can cast his vote. Once a person casted his vote cannot cast it again for that election so that there will be no Fake Voting.</br>
On the day of Election Result will be automatically tallied.</br>
This entire web application will be secured by Azure Blockchain service.</br>
